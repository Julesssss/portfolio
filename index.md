I am a software engineer with a keen interest in the Android platform. I enjoy creating personal projects to solve problems and writing about my engineering experiences. This site contains these projects and blog posts.

As a professional engineer, I have been responsible for Architecting and leading Android projects in a variety of areas (VOT/OTT streaming, IOT, social, sports, Ecommerce). Some of my current focuses include architectural design, state management, reactive programming and continuous integration.

Currently, I live and work in London. I am looking for companies with experienced engineering teams that are solving interesting problems. Please reach out to me if you have an engineering position that might be suitable for me.
