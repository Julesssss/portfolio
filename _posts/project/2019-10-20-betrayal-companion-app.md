Character attribute tracker for 'Betrayal at the House on the Hill' board game, replacing the provided character cards.

- Removes the need to track attributes with the included character cards.
- Play with multiple characters from the same colour (player limit increases to 12).
- Attributes are persisted to device, so that games can be continued at a later date.
