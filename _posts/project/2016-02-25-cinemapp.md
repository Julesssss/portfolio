<p class="project-type">Professional project</p>

CinemApp was the first project I built professionally. It is a social app for cinema lovers, who can find other users to chat and watch movies with. Local cinemas and moview showings can be searched by location. Group chat rooms can be used to discuss the movie and arrange viewings.

It consumes a film showtime API and heavily uses the Google Maps API.
